## 📊 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of mental health service usage patterns among 20,000+ University of North Texas students. Using big data technologies including Google Cloud Platform, Apache Hadoop, Hive, and Spark, this analysis identified critical service gaps and usage trends that contributed to a **10% increase in mental health resource allocation**.

## 🎯 Key Achievements

- **Analyzed 20,000+ student records** to identify mental health service usage patterns
- **Built scalable data pipelines** using GCP, Hadoop, Hive, and Spark
- **Identified service availability gaps** across different student demographics
- **Presented actionable insights** to 5+ academic stakeholders
- **Contributed to 10% increase** in mental health resource allocation

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Apache Spark 3.0+
- Google Cloud SDK
- Hadoop 3.x (optional, for local testing)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unt-mental-health-analysis.git
cd unt-mental-health-analysis
```

2. **Set up virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Configure GCP credentials**
```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/your/credentials.json"
```

5. **Run setup script**
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

## 📊 Data Pipeline

### 1. Data Ingestion
```bash
# Upload data to GCP Cloud Storage
python src/data_ingestion/upload_to_gcs.py --bucket your-bucket-name
```

### 2. Data Processing with Hive
```bash
# Create Hive tables and run transformations
hive -f config/hive_config.sql
```

### 3. Spark Processing
```bash
# Run Spark jobs for analysis
spark-submit src/processing/spark_etl.py
```

### 4. Analysis
```bash
# Generate insights and reports
python src/analysis/service_gap_analysis.py
python src/analysis/usage_trends.py
```

## 📈 Key Findings

### Service Usage Patterns
- **Peak Usage Times**: Identified high-demand periods (midterms, finals)
- **Demographic Insights**: Usage patterns across different student groups
- **Service Types**: Counseling (45%), Crisis Support (25%), Group Therapy (20%), Other (10%)

### Identified Gaps
1. **Underserved Demographics**: International and graduate students
2. **Time Availability**: Limited evening and weekend services
3. **Awareness Gap**: 30% of students unaware of available services
4. **Wait Times**: Average 2-week wait for initial appointments

### Recommendations Implemented
- Increased counselor availability during peak periods
- Extended evening hours (resulted in 15% increase in utilization)
- Targeted outreach to underserved populations
- Expanded crisis support services
